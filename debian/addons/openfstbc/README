#Bash completion file for OpenFst 1.2
#Copyright Paul Dixon 2011 (paul@edobashira.com)
#Tested on Ubuntu 10.04 using bash 4.5 
#To use simply source the completion file.
#source openfstbc
#These bash completions will add tab completion to the OpenFst flags. This file adds three types of completions based on the flag’s value type.
#Flags which accept path, numeric values will complete with a trailing = character and then default to the standard path completion.
#Binary flags will complete without a trailing = character.
#Flags which can accepted an enumerable string value will complete will a trailing = and then suggest suitable values. For example the –arc_type= completions will suggest log and standard values parameters.
